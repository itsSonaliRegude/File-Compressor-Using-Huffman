How it will run, how does it work?

In order to run the application, first step is to download all the project files in this branch and then put them in an appropriate folder.
We have provided an executable .jar as well as .exe file inside the folder named "Executable" in which you will find files named "EncodorGUI.jar" and "Encoder.exe".
You can click on any one of these to execute the application. (There is also an alternative way to execute the project, you can open the project in any IDE and execute 
the main method inside the class "EncoderGUI").
Upon opening the application you will be given an option to browse a file and select it. After you have selected your file, choose the location where you want to 
save the compressed file. After you have done all these steps you can hit the "Compress" Button to compress your file.
